    "# Spatial Querying of GEDI Version 2 Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ([GEDI](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data/get-started-data/collection-overview/missions/gedi-overview/)) mission aims to characterize ecosystem structure and dynamics to enable radically improved quantification and understanding of the Earth's carbon cycle and biodiversity. The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) distributes the GEDI Level 1 and Level 2 Version 1 and Version 2 products. The LP DAAC created the GEDI Finder _Web Service_ to allow users to perform spatial queries of GEDI _Version 1_ L1-L2 full-orbit granules. One of the updates for GEDI _Version 2_ included additional spatial metadata that allows users to perform spatial queries via a graphical user interface (GUI) using NASA's [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) or programmatically using NASA's [Common Metadata Repository](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) (CMR). Another update is that each GEDI V1 full-orbit granule has been divided into 4 sub-orbit granules in V2.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### This tutorial will show how to use Python to perform a spatial query for GEDI V2 data using NASA's CMR, how to reformat the CMR response into a list of links pointing to the intersecting sub-orbit granules, and how to export the list of links as a text file. \n",
    "---\n",
    "## Use Case Example:  \n",
    "This tutorial was developed using an example use case for a current GEDI Finder user who has been using the GEDI Finder web service in Python to find intersecting GEDI L2A Version 1 full-orbit granules over the Amazon Rainforest. The user is now looking to use the same workflow to find intersecting GEDI L2A V2 sub-orbit granules. \n",
