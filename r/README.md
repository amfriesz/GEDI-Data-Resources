# Spatial Querying of GEDI Version 2 Data in R

---
# Objective:
### The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to use R to perform spatial [bounding box] queries for GEDI V2 L1B, L2A, and L2B data using NASA's CMR, and how to reformat the CMR response into a list of links that will allow users to download the intersecting GEDI V2 sub-orbit granules directly from the LP DAAC Data Pool.
