# Repository Setup Instructions

The tutorials and Executables in this repository require a compatible Python Environment and installation of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You also may need to download GEDI granules. To setup the environment and download these files, follow the steps in sections 1 and 2. 

+ If you do not have Git, you can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  

## 1. Environment Setup
### Python

This Python Environment will work for all of the Python tutorials and executables within this repository. It is recommended to use Conda, an environment manager to set up a compatible Python environment. Download Conda for your OS here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Additional information on setting up and managing Conda environments can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). Once you have Conda installed, Follow the instructions below to successfully setup a Python environment on Linux, MacOS, or Windows.

This Python Jupyter Notebook tutorial has been tested using Python version 3.9. 

Using your preferred command line interface (command prompt, terminal, cmder, etc.) type the following to successfully create a compatible python environment:
> `conda create -n gedi -c conda-forge --yes python=3.9 h5py shapely geopandas pandas geoviews holoviews`

Next, activate the Python Environment that you just created.

> `conda activate gedi`

Now you can launch Jupyter Notebook to open the notebooks included.

> `jupyter notebook`

If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed, you may need to run:

> `conda install jupyter notebook`

**Having trouble getting a compatible Python environment set up? Contact [LP DAAC User Services](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac-contact-us/).**

+ If you do not have an Environment Manager installed, we recommend  [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). When installing, be sure to check the box to "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" to enable use of conda directly from your command line interface. If you prefer to not install Conda, the same setup and dependencies can be achieved by using another package manager such as pip.
